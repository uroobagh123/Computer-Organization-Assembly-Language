# Computer Organization & Assembly Language

This repository contains all my **lab tasks**, and **practice programs** from the Computer Organization & Assembly Language course, written in **x86 Assembly**.

## 📂 Contents

- `Basics/` – Programs involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, division  
- `Bitwise Operations/` – Logical shifts, rotates, and masking operations  
- `Control Flow/` – Loops, conditional jumps, and decision-making  
- `Procedures & Stack/` – Subroutines using stack frames and local variables  
- `Sorting & Searching/` – Bubble sort, linear search, and related logic  
- `String Operations/` – Display and manipulation of strings in assembly  
- `Practice/` – Miscellaneous code for experimentation and learning  

## 💡 Topics Covered

- Registers, memory, and flags in x86 architecture  
- Addressing modes and instruction set  
- Bitwise and arithmetic operations  
- Stack usage and subroutine handling  
- Looping and branching techniques  
- DOS interrupts and screen handling  
- Sorting, searching, and basic algorithms in assembly  

## 🖥️ How to Run the Programs

Use **EMU8086**, **NASM**, or another x86 emulator to compile and run the `.asm` files.

### Example (EMU8086):
1. Open the `.asm` file in EMU8086.  
2. Assemble (`F5`).  
3. Run (`F9`).
